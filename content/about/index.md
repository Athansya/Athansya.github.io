### Hello again,
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

My name is Alfonso, a mexican biomedical engineer and soon to be a masterÂ´s student in computer sciences. I always enjoyed life sciences and math, but quite recently discovered my love for programming.  I thoroughly enjoy learning on my own about my different interests: programming, medical imaging, mathematics, artificial intelligence, languages, etcetera. I love sharing my knowledge and teaching others, so making a website seemed like a terrific idea. 

Other hobbies of mine are: singing, exercising, reading and going out in search of the best food. I want to devote myself to researching and teaching at a university, although I don't rule out the idea of continuing to share my knowledge online. I've work in a couple of research projects related to medical image and signal processing with artificial intelligence. For a better description of my academic and work life, I invite you to check out my [CV](CV.pdf).
