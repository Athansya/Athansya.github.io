### Hello again,
<div style="text-align: justify"> 

My name is Alfonso Toriz Vázquez (I attached a portrait of me made by a friend <a href="#section1">[1]</a>), a mexican biomedical engineering student and soon to be a master´s student in artificial intelligence . I have always enjoyed life sciences and math, but quite recently I discovered my love for programming. I thoroughly enjoy learning on my own about my different interests: programming, medical imaging, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, languages, etcetera. Other hobbies of mine are: singing, exercising, reading and going out in search of great food. I want to devote myself to researching and teaching at a university, although I don't rule out the idea of continuing to share my knowledge online. I've work in several research projects related to medical image and signal processing with artificial intelligence. For a better description of my academic and work life, I invite you to check out my [CV](CV.pdf).
