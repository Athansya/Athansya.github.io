I always thought that learning to code in C would be a difficult and rather tedious experience compared to the high-level languages (e.g Python or Matlab) I was familiar with. Hence, I did what every student in my situation would do: procrastinate until the very last moment. Who would have though that, in order to prepare myself for my future internship position, my supervisor would asked me to learn C beforehand...

Thus, this Learning C programming series was born, to help me study and practice new concepts. I'll try to follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and keep each new entry as brief and concise as possible. Most of the material will be based on Zed Shaw's Learning C Programming the Hard Way, although I'll be adding more references if needed.

Recommendations
</b></p>

* Use a simple editor (e.g. Nano) without autocompletion enabled to train your memory.
* Write your own code, don't just copy over the material.
* Be curious! If you have a doubt add a comment below.
